Abstract :
The consumer finance company specializes in different types of loans to the
urban customer. The major problem they face is when the customer fails
to replay the loan . Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s
decision:
• If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan
results in a loss of business to the company
• If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to
default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the
company
Business Objective :
• The aim of this analysis is to try to find the customers who are likely to pay the
loan and who are likely to default.
• We aim to find the parameters that significantly influences a customer’s
probability of being a defaulter thereby taking necessary actions.
